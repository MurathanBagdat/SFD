# 2. Aim of the Project

To build sensor fault detection system on highly critical compressor that has 41 different sensor on it in a refinery process.

# 3. File Descriptions

There are 5 files in this project.
177K201_sensorNameList.xlsx	is a excel file that is sensor names are listed. This list is used for data fecthing process from company database.


Project consist of 2 types of files. One of them csv files that I used as datasources. Second one is jupyter notebook file that you can find my analysis about the subject.
